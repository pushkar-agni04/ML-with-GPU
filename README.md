## Key Learnings:
1. What is CUDA?
- CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model.
- It acts as the software layer and instruction set that allows general-purpose programming languages (like C++ and Python) to directly utilize the thousands of small, parallel processing cores on an NVIDIA GPU.
- **Impact**: CUDA is the indispensable foundation for achieving the massive speedups seen in modern AI/ML workloads.
